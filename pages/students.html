    <h1>Prospective Students</h1>
<p>Our research group is currently full and I am unfortunately not accpeting student applications for Fall, 2022.</p>
<h1>Current Students</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nick Cunetta:</strong> Nick received his B.S. from Tufts University and is studying the deformation history of high-grade subduction rocks in the Easton Metamorphic Suite, northwest Washington to test models of metamorphic sole formation during subduction initiation. Co-advised with Liz Schermer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emily Gates:</strong> Emily recevied her B.S. from UC Santa Barbara and is studying the deformation history of regional blueschsit facies rocks in the Easton Metamorphic Suite, northwest Washington to test models for underplating and accretion in subduction systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tomas Urbina:</strong> Tomas is a senior at Western and using zircon and muscovite geochronology to test correlation between subduction zone units in the Norhtwest Cascades Thrust System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kalieh Singleton:</strong> Kalieh received her B.S. from Western Washington University and she is working on the timing and correlation of ophiolite units within the Northwest Cascades Thrust System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Katie Lang:</strong> Katie received her B.S. from William and Mary and she is studying the depositional history of the Easton Metamorphic Suite, northwest Washington to understand how rocks sedimentary rocks are incorporated into subduction zones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
