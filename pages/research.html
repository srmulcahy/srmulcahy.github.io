    <h1>Subduction zone deformation and metamorphism</h1>
<p><img alt="Blueschist" src="https://srmulcahy.github.io/images/research-subduction.png"></p>
<p>Ancient subduction zones provide important information on the physical and chemical evolution of the crust, the history and correlation of past tectonic events, and the timescales of subduction zone processes. Despite the importance of subduction zones to a broad range of geological problems, the mechanisms by which subduction zones initiate and evolve towards steady state are not fully understood. We are working to test models for subduction zone evolution in order to understand how subduction zones initiate, how rocks thermally evolove in space and time within a subduction zone, how and material is accreted and ultimately exhumed. Our group is addressing these questions through an NSF-funded investigation of the Easton Metamorphic Suite in the Northwest Cascades of Washington using combined field mapping, structural and microstructural analysis, metamorphic petrology, and geochronology to establish a detailed reconstruction of the subduction history in order to test the proposed models for early subduction zone evolution.</p>

<h1>Origin and evolution of large-scale lower-crustal shear zones</h1>
<p><img alt="Mylonite" src="https://srmulcahy.github.io/images/research-shearzone.png"></p>
<p>The presence of major fault zones within continental crust which show evidence for reactivation over 100s of millions of years defies models for continuum deformation of the continents, wherein faults are viewed as passive features responding to mantle flow. Large-scale faults occur on every continent and many long-lived intracontinental fault systems record complex histories of reactivation, in particular localizing convergent and strike-slip deformation. We are testing competing models for the origin of persistent large-scale faults by studying the tectonic history of exhumed middle and lower crust sections of an ancient fault zone. End member models predict that such fault zones originate either as: 1) convergent-collisional boundaries between blocks of different strength, 2) transform boundaries along pre-existing zones of weakness, or 3) strike-slip boundaries within the arc-forearc region of oblique subduction settings. The Valle Fertil fault zone of western Argentina is an approximately 1200-kilometer-long major crustal lineament that records at least 400 million years of intermittent deformation and is an ideal location to test the above models because of excellent geophysical constraints on crustal strength contrasts, variable depths of exposure along strike, a well constrained tectonic evolution, and ideal mineral assemblages for dating the history of deformation within the fault. The results from the Valle Fertil fault can be applied to other intracontinental faults to address what factors determine the origin of major structures within complex orogens and the processes by which they ultimately become large-scale faults with complex histories of continued reactivation.</p>
